BRENDAN HOLMES

Born in Melbourne, I spent the first 23 years not doing engineering, but now I'm doing engineering.

My role in this project is deleting brackets and commas. 

My preferred branch of engineering is electrical, after my hero, Don, who I'm still undecided as to whether he is a mafia boss or not.
